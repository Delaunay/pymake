202208017.  Welcome to PyMake. 

Hello! Welcome!

My goal is a source level debugger for GNU Makefiles. (Nothing against other
Make implementations but I have to start somewhere.) The plan is to have a text
interface like gdb.

The project is very early. I can parse almost all of fully formed makefiles.  I
can output S-expressions, regenerate the makefile. 

As of this writing, I am implementing the GNU make $() functions. I cannot yet
execute rules so I'm not yet actually a fully functioning Make.

Example usage:
	# read a makefile, dumps incredible amounts of debugging while parsing.
	# Output of the makefile got to stdout
	python3 pymake.py Makefile

	# Example: parse/execute functions.mk, rewrite the makefile from the parsed
	# source to out.mk (very useful for seeing a cleaned makefile)
	python3 pymake.py -o out.mk functions.mk
